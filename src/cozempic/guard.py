"""Guard daemon — continuous team checkpointing + emergency prune.

Architecture:
  EVERY interval:  Extract team state → write checkpoint (lightweight, no prune)
  AT threshold:    Prune non-team messages → inject recovery → optionally reload

The checkpoint runs continuously so team state is ALWAYS on disk, regardless
of whether the threshold is ever hit. The threshold prune is the emergency
fallback — not the primary protection mechanism.

Checkpoint triggers:
  1. Every N seconds (guard daemon)
  2. On demand via `cozempic checkpoint` (hook-driven)
  3. At file size threshold (emergency prune)

# When ``guard_prune_cycle`` keeps returning saved_bytes == 0 at the HARD
# threshold (because the live conversation is dominated by immutable tool-
# result blocks the soft prune cannot touch), the daemon used to loop at the
# original 30s interval indefinitely — production log showed 265 cycles over
# 5h21m. The current contract:
#
#   K < HARD_LOOP_BACKOFF_START   → sleep ``interval`` (original cadence)
#   K >= HARD_LOOP_BACKOFF_START  → sleep min(interval * 2 ** (K - 2),
#                                              HARD_LOOP_BACKOFF_CAP_SECONDS)
#   K >= HARD_LOOP_EXIT_THRESHOLD → log diagnostic, write final checkpoint,
#                                   sys.exit(0). SessionStart hook will respawn.
#
# Any prune that returns saved_bytes > 0 resets K to 0 (counter never decays
# on its own — only a genuine prune signals "we can still make progress").
# The cap is 5 minutes: longer is operator-hostile (HARD threshold context
# may genuinely need attention), shorter wastes cycles on doomed prunes.

# finish before context dies.

# 12+ chars keeps the ``[:12]`` truncation meaningful and prevents

# ── In-flight work detector (1.8.22 safe-point gate, component A) ─────────────
# A guard reload SIGKILLs the Claude process and resumes from the pruned
# transcript. Harness-side state that is NOT in the transcript — a running
# Workflow-tool orchestration, a background subagent — is destroyed with no
# recovery. cozempic could not see these before. This detects them from the
# transcript via launch/completion markers (both DO appear in the JSONL):
#   - Workflow launch:  "Workflow launched in background. Task ID: <id>"
#   - background launch: "running in background with ID: <id>"
#   - completion:        <task-notification>...<task-id><id></task-id>...<status>completed|failed</status>
# plus any open synchronous tool_use with no matching tool_result (a tool/subagent
# mid-call). Conservative by construction: it flags only on positive
# launch-without-completion or a genuinely open call, so it does not over-defer.
# Launch markers — VERIFIED against real Claude Code transcripts (2026-06-07,
# 195 Agent / 12 Workflow / 0 Task tool_uses across 13 sessions). The dominant
# real path is the `Agent` tool's "Async agent launched successfully. agentId: X"
# (background subagent) — the original detector matched only the Workflow/Task-ID
# phrasing, which is NOT what the harness emits, so a running background subagent
# was invisible and a reload would SIGKILL it. All three launch ids complete via
# the SAME-namespace <task-notification><task-id>X</task-id> block, so
# launched−completed accounting works once each launch phrasing is recognized.
# Patterns are drift-tolerant (optional "the"/punctuation, Task|Run ID, ID:/=/( ).

    Used by every daemon shutdown surface (SIGTERM handler, K=10
    voluntary exit, KeyboardInterrupt, the four `break` paths in
    ``start_guard``'s main loop). Wired through the ``finally`` block
    of ``start_guard`` so a single call site covers all 6 exit paths.

    CAS gate: only unlinks if the pidfile currently contains OUR PID
    (``_pid_file_points_to(session_id, os.getpid())``). This prevents
    destroying a peer's just-completed claim during the brief window
    where a concurrent SessionStart hook may have already spawned a
    replacement daemon and rewritten the pidfile with its PID. Mirrors
    the CAS pattern in ``reload_self_daemon`` (sister-module precedent
    at lines 1802, 1809, 1823, 1829).

    Swallows ValueError (malformed session_id passed in via stale
    closure capture) and OSError (pidfile already gone, /tmp unwritable,
    EACCES). Never raises — the daemon is mid-shutdown; nothing useful
    to do on failure.

    Class-of-bug fold (PR #93 commit 2): consolidates the unlink so
    adding a new ``sys.exit`` path requires touching ONE callsite, not
    N. Covers the pre-existing ``_graceful_shutdown`` leak (TODO:55,
    pre-PR-#88) AND the K=10 leak PR #92 introduced — both daemon-exit
    surfaces now reach the same ``finally`` block in ``start_guard``.
